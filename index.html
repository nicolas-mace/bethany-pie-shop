                    <h2>Our history</h2>
                    <p>
                        Welcome to <b>Bethany's Pie Shop</b>, where pie-baking perfection meets convenience! For
                        countless
                        years,
                        Bethany's
                        passion for crafting the most scrumptious pies has been an unmatched delight. Our journey began
                        in
                        2013
                        when we
                        unveiled our first charming store in the heart of Brussels (Belgium), nestled in a cozy little
                        street
                        near the
                        illustrious Grand Market. It was here that our pies first captured the hearts and taste buds of
                        people
                        from
                        every corner of the globe, from delectable soft cakes to heavenly cheesecakes and tantalizingly
                        spiced
                        apple
                        pies. <i>Our store's extraordinary success was nothing short of a culinary fairy tale.</i>

                    <p>
                        As the demand for Bethany's divine creations soared, an incredible milestone was reached in
                        2015,
                        when
                        we
                        proudly sold an astonishing 100 pies each day! Naturally, our beloved Pie Shop had to evolve,
                        and we
                        relocated
                        to a grander, more spacious building to better serve our cherished patrons. The love and support
                        we
                        received
                        from our ever-growing community inspired us to explore new possibilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In response to numerous heartfelt requests from pie enthusiasts far and wide, we knew the time
                        had
                        come to bring our mouthwatering treats to your doorstep. Thus, in 2023, the idea of our very own
                        webstore was born: a virtual haven where you can now relish the delight of ordering Bethany's
                        scrumptious pies from the comfort of your own home, no matter where you reside in the world.</p>
